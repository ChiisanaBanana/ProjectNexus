The vinyl flooring is great for me with my allergies not being bothered. I can run the AC cool with the great insulation. I feel valued as a resident with the rate increases, while hard to cope with, are still below market, so I feel that staying here is appreciated. Maintenance is quick to fix problems. Shane Morgan was the best manager that's been here. If I could change one thing, it would be the dishwasher. It's terrible. The top rack doesn't have enough clearance and the wash tower is inferior to a second dedicated spray arm for the upper rack, which most modern dishwashers come equipped with. As far as info I wish I knew when I moved in, a sign for the washing machine reading 'Tip: if you start the wash cycle with an empty tub, then the machine will fill to the max waterline.' When I first moved in, the machine didn't properly wash my comforter. The top remained bone dry and detergent was still sitting on top, clear indicators that the top of the comforter didn't get cleaned at all. After complaining, maintenance gave me this tip and now I can wash my comforters and am grateful for this tip every time I run the washing machine.",Positive,2,0.9921

My only bad experience was the unexpected loss of my husband before we were here two years. The office staff were very kind and understanding and have been very supportive. It is however disappointing to see the turnover in the office staff as well as managers. It's difficult to establish a good rapport when they come and go. The maintenance department has experienced the same turnover however it is a pleasure to have some continuity with Pasquale and Marcus. The grounds are well maintained now with the new landscaping vendor however it's the tenants who litter and let their dogs go all over the sidewalks and grass. Constant memos and emails appear to have little effect. Some people just don't follow rules. I like my apartment and the convenience to stores and activities.
