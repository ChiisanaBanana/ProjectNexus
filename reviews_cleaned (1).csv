5bf3a00a-2a01-4b42-832c-cc1022a99d02,"Disappointing. My husband and I have lived at The Carlton At Lake Dexter since March 2024. We were so thrilled to be moving into a brand new apartment complex and to have a first floor apartment on the lake. We were also excited to have access to a year round heated pool. It didn’t take long for us to realize that we had made a bad decision about moving here. It has been nothing but a huge disappointment. The pool is always dirty and they do not run the heater all of the time. When you inquire about it you are told that the pool is cleaned every day and that the heater works. Yesterday we went to the pool at 10:30 am only to find someone had left behind clothes, shoes, toys and garbage that were left laying around all day. The pool had dirt and algae and no one cleaned it. And a lot of the residents here are so rude and disrespectful, they act like the pool area is their personal back yard pool. They have no respect for their community. Three people were vaping, women wearing string thong bikinis (no cover ups), young children left unattended in…",1.0,2/10/2025,The Carlton at Lake Dexter,Yes

It's been almost 3 years that I live here and I have never seen someone that does its job so good. When I first moved here it was winter 2022, my house was freezing and the maintenance guy at that time said my house was too big and it wouldn't heat because of the size. The last 3 winters me and my family had to freeze in our house because I believed the size of the apartment was the problem. Until I called Rocky. He solved a 3 year old problem in 5 minutes. He does EVERYTHING so well done and so fast, always with a good humor, nice conversation and with a smile on his face, he has saved us so many times since he's started working here, he is very knowledgeable of his job and I truly hope he stays here and gets compensated for his hard work because he deserves it.

The apartment we are in faces the cars and you can hear cars park at times, nothing too bad but with how the balconies are positioned near the master bedroom you can hear neighbors out on the balconies because of the proximity to the main bedroom window.

With that being said, I have not once seen security doing regular checkups, so there really isn't a sense of security, even gated communities have regular security guards doing security drives. Parking isn't enforced either, even with parking violation stickers plastered on cars/ boats lacking registration or being improperly parked there is no accountability for parking violations.

The new management company, Providence Mgmt, came in and raised my base rent $550! The office manager is clueless and possibly the worst general manager I have had to deal with. Nicole Hoffman does not care about the tenants and is completely unprofessional and disrespectful. They ended up paying me to leave due to a huge problem with RATS! Paying $2450 for a 2/2 is ridiculous when you have to deal with these problems! All they do is paint over the mold! The property looks great on the outside but it's all a facade!

One of the main reasons I choose this community was because all the safety that was falsy promised and the gate has been open more than it has been closed.

Neighborhood: Wonderful location, right next to a Lymmo Lime line pickup for a free bus ride to Lynx Central where you can catch a connecting bus to other downtown locations, Disney locations, or Universal Maintenance: Maintenance team is responsive and responsible. They've promptly fixed all issues I've reported, and if an issue returned they were prompt to resolve it again. Staff: Staff is very friendly and helpful!",4.3,10/14/2024,NORA,Yes

bbf67a2f-23d6-459f-957c-4424057d750d,The apartment itself is great. The only things I don't like is the lack of storage space/closet space and the fancy cabinets. They're pretty but not very functional. Hallways are for the most part very clean. I do notice when there is an issue with pet urine in the halls/elevator its there for a few days before it is taken care of. I havent seen the cleaners I would always see on the first floor for a while which may be why. Communication from the office leaves a lot to be disired. On the 5th floor we have had half of our spots blocked off with next to little communication as to why or when we will get access to them again. I did figure out why when I saw the cement run off stains on my car but no communications on that at all and I didnt even bother mention it to them because I know they wont care my car was damaged. The little bit of sound that does come through can be prevented with better unit doors that dont leave a gap underneath.,4.3,5/29/2024,NORA,Yes

The biggest problem is noise from other apartments. Neighbors are constantly playing loud music with heavy bass and you can hear your neighbors above you pretty clearly. In the pool area people often play music way too loud when having a party. Otherwise the community is quiet outside of that. I'm not sure if they actually recycle either since they use the same container for both the trash and recycling which is a bummer.

f2e6e9e5-9f1e-4cce-aa00-6ab816616725,"Since I first moved in the ownership/management has changed. Although there have been many positive improvements management needs to make tenants more responsible for their actions and behavior. Based on the lease no more than 2 guests at the pool, no glass, no speakers and no pets which is never the case. Maybe security is needed on the weekends to enforce rules to make it more enjoyable for the entire community.

Instead of management helping their tenants, they completely ignore you & hope for problems to resolve themseleves. Plumbing is non exsistent. The apartment above mine was leaking into my entire bathroom for 5 months. There is mold in my bathroom ceiling/water damage & we were told it’d be replaced. Still no word from management on this. Our dishwasher is broken/constantly smelly from mold/doesn’t wash dishes properly & management told us we need to “clean it.” The kitchen sink is currently leaking into the cabinets creating more mold/water damage. We were told this would be fixed in 2 days time, & they’ve ghosted us ever since. We are having to put multiple trash cans under the sink to catch the leaking water so it doesn’t spill out onto our kitchen floor. Don’t forget that there are always fruit flies in the building & dogs are welcome to release themselves wherever they like.

The location is excellent?close to major attractions, restaurants, supermarkets, shopping malls, and playgrounds. If proximity to entertainment and convenience is important, this place has it. ?	The maintenance crew is fantastic. They're always friendly, responsive, and go above and beyond to help with any issues that come up. ?	A special shout-out to Josie, who works hard to make things right, although she seems to lack support from the corporate office. The Negatives: ?	Unfortunately, corporate doesn't seem to care about the property. There's been a significant decline in upkeep. ?	Dog feces are everywhere because many residents don't clean up after their pets, and management doesn't enforce rules. ?	The spa has been closed for about six months, despite earlier promises that it would reopen soon. Now, we hear nothing about it. ?	They started replacing carpets in the first building months ago, but the project has completely stalled. The carpets across the complex are filthy, and there's no regular cleaning crew on weekends, leaving common areas in terrible condition. Don't be surprised if you see dog piss on a Saturday morning as you enter the elevator o walk out the door. ?	The grounds are poorly maintained.

Maintenance staff and front desk are helpful and nice. There are lights in the parking lot and stairwell, which is helpful at night. Cons: Property manager is not helpful or friendly. It used to feel safer with a gate to get in, as it served as a deterrent for random people coming in and that also limited them parking in the lot. They removed it without informing residents why and created reserved parking spots for a fee. That just limits the spots for the residents who don't want to or can't incur an additional charge. Though, there are usually still spots a little bit further away. They add in extra services that you must pay for in a bundle when you rent the apartment, even if you don't use those services, which makes the overall cost more expensive.",4.0,12/18/2024,The Reserve at Alafaya,Yes

There’s trash and litter everywhere. The floors are rarely if ever cleaned in the common areas. Don’t even get me started on the stairwells. There’s no security here so be prepared to bring your own.

Then when they fix something they pat themselves on the back like they’re so proud of themselves and are self-congratulatory while the residents sometimes wait their entire lease for things to be fixed!

Chose Adele not only because I had lived at a sister property but loved all that it offered. Everyone was so nice and getting into the apartment was a seamless process. The apartment is upgraded and having recently downsized is the perfect for me, it has everything I need. It offers a basketball court which my son will love when visiting. I am enjoying the fitness and crossfit gym when I get home. Haven't had the opportunity to use the pool but will when my kids visit. Overall very happy with my choice",5.0,9/23/2020,Adele Place,Yes

What sold me on the property was the screened porch because my cat loves to hang out in the sun. The apartment has a washer and dryer which I love and a large kitchen so I can cook in. Everyone is super friendly and the place is very quiet. I lived in a high rise prior and always heard people walking by and noise from the pool area so this is beyond peaceful.

64a1f2ad-f2a9-40cb-88cd-de2342adb383,"Do yourself a favor and DO NOT MOVE HERE. I have given this place MANY chances. We've been here less than one year and we've experienced mold growing in both closets, roaches, useless light switches, leaking pipes, a bursted pipe, leaking AC which has caused more mold and probably explains the mold into the adjacent closets now that I think about it (they originally said the mold formed because we weren't keeping our AC running 24/7 ). Mold is now growing along the wall of our pantry and has caused damage to walls. These apartments paint over mold or damage as if that fixes the problem. The sealing on the floor to the wall, as well as bathroom countertop sealing is shotty at best and provided home for the roaches mentioned earlier. Yes they spray and took care of the roach problem but never came to fix the sealing issue. The bathroom has no ventilation and probably reinforces mold growth in the closets. This is Florida so opening the window is not an option as it is typically 40% humidity or more outside.",1.8,4/26/2020,Adele Place,Yes
